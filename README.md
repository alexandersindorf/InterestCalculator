# InterestCalculator

This program was developed as a tool for investors to calculate compund interests for there investments; with and without continuous deposits.
I was able to almost identically match the UI of the project requirements.  I also added a few lines to keep the formating of the output consistent
while the balance of the account reaches higher numbers.
To enhance the code, I further integrate functions into my class.  This would clean up my main function, and make it easier to add features to the
program in the future.
The most difficult part of the project was making it object oriented.  Through practice, I am continuing to grow my knowledge with writing and
debugging OOP programs.  Although I have a theorhetical understanding of how to implement my functions into an object, trouble debugging the code
had led me to leave much of it out of the class.
Having this experience as a baseline for OOP, I will be able to start OOP projects easier.  This head start will allow me to focus on implementing
more of the functions into the object.
To make this program maintanable, readable, and adaptable I used clear names for functions and variables.  I sepereated tasks from the main function
into their own function, as well as using OOP.
